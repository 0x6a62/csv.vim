- add vertical folding (concealing columns)
  (works partly, can't conceal single columns?)
- add a wizard, for defining fixed-width columns
  (should work now)
- Reapply Filter, in case Search register changed
  (use :Filters!, should work now)
- make plugin autoloadable
- wrap/shorten long fields (scopus.csv). Is this
  even possible with Vim?
