- add vertical folding (concealing columns)
  (works partly, can't conceal single columns?)
- apply Filter negatively, e.g. pressing enter on a value, hides all
  values, that don't have this value. (Maybe use <Space>, on the value?)
- When filtering, move all folded values together, so your file needs to
  be reorded (and changed), but will leave all non-folded items
  together. Make this configurable and only possible, when the file is
  !read-only and modifiable)
- make plugin autoloadable (shouldn't be necessary, as the code is only
  loaded for file with &ft=csv)
- wrap/shorten long fields (scopus.csv). Is this even possible with Vim?

## Fixed items
- add a wizard, for defining fixed-width columns
  (should work now)
- Reapply Filter, in case Search register changed
  (use :Filters!, should work now)
- Sum should account for different number formats
  (e.g. 10 000.01 should be counted as 10,000.01 in Australia,
  10.000 should be counted as 10,000 in Germany.

  How can the user configure how to handle certain delimiters?
  :SumCol 3 /.:,/ should use the ',' as decimal separator?
  :SumCol 3 /,: / should use the ' ' as thousands separator?
  :SumCol 3 /,: / /.:,/ treats ' ' as thousands separator and
  , as decimal separator?
  (should work now)
