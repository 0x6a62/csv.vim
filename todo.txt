- add vertical folding (concealing columns)
  (works partly, can't conceal single columns?)
- add a wizard, for defining fixed-width columns
  (should work now)
- Reapply Filter, in case Search register changed
  (use :Filters!, should work now)
- Sum should account for different number formats
  (e.g. 10 000.01 should be counted as 10,000.01 in Australia,
  10.000 should be counted as 10,000 in Germany.

  How can the user configure how to handle certain delimiters?
  :SumCol 3 /.:,/ should use the ',' as decimal separator?
  :SumCol 3 /,: / should use the ' ' as thousands separator?
  :SumCol 3 /,: / /.:,/ treats ' ' as thousands separator and
  , as decimal separator?
- make plugin autoloadable
- wrap/shorten long fields (scopus.csv). Is this
  even possible with Vim?
